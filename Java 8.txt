Java 8:
Optional:
isPresent will return boolean value whether value is present or not.
ifPresent will execute statement inside it if value is present.
orElse is used to display string if data does not matches.
orElseGet()-> is used to execute lambda expression if data does not matches
orElsethrow() to thorw an error.
optional.of is used when you data is present
optional.offnullable is used when data is not used.

Lambda Interface:
First we need to define interface with singe abstract method.
Use that abstract method inside Implemented class.
For Ex: Functional1Interface is interface class name and printhello is its method.
private static void Functional1Interface() {
		Functional1Interface abc = () -> System.out.println("hello I am in ");
		abc.printHello();
